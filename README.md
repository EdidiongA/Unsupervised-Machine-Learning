Unsupervised learning algorithms (Expectation Maximization (EM) and k-Means Clustering algorithms) and dimensionality reduction (DR) algorithms (Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Random Projections (RP) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)) are applied to the following two datasets from Assignment 1, and the results are analyzed.
1. A Rice dataset, a multivariate binary classification dataset, obtained at UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, for two types of rice species grown in Turkey (Cammeo and Osmancik). The dataset has 3810 instances and contains seven (7) features in the feature set (X). the target variable (y) is whether the rice species is Cammeo or Osmancik.
2. A Spambase dataset, a multivariate binary classification dataset, obtained at UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository, which classifies emails as spam or non-spam. The dataset has integer and real data types. The dataset has 4601 instances with 57 features in the feature set (X). The target variable (y) is whether the email is spam or not.
